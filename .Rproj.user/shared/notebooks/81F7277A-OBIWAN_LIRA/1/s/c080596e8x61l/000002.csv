"2","16 of 1600 (1.0%) transitions hit the maximum treedepth limit of 10 or 2^10-1 leapfrog steps.
Trajectories that are prematurely terminated due to this limit will result in slow exploration.
Increasing the max_treedepth limit can avoid this at the expense of more computation.
If increasing max_treedepth does not remove warnings, try to reparameterize the model.
